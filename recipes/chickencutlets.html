    <h1> Chicken Cutlets </h1>
    <img src="../images/chickencutlets1.jpg">

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p1>A chicken cutlet is a boneless, skinless chicken breast that has been sliced horizontally in half, creating two
        thinner pieces, often further pounded with a meat mallet to achieve an even thickness, allowing for faster and
        more even cooking compared to a whole chicken breast; essentially, it's a thin, flattened piece of chicken
        breast.
    </p1>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <em>
            <h3>
                <li>Season the chicken</li>
            </h3>
        </em>
        <p>Generously season both sides of the chicken cutlets with salt and black pepper.</p>
        <em>
            <h3>
                <li>Prepare a dredging station</li>
            </h3>
        </em>
        <p> Set up the chicken next to three large deep plates or shallow bowls. I like to work in order from left to
            right: spread add 1/2 cup all-purpose flour in the first bowl. Beat 2 eggs in the second bowl. Finally, stir
            together 1 cup breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup grated parmesan, and 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning in the third. Set up
            an empty plate or tray for the breaded cutlets on the right.</p>
        <em>
            <h3>
                <li>Bread the chicken cutlets</li>
            </h3>
        </em>
        <p>Working one at a time, place a chicken cutlet in the bowl of flour and coat both sides, shaking off the
            excess. Then transfer the cutlet to the bowl of beaten eggs and coat both sides, letting the excess runoff.
            Set the cutlet in the breadcrumbs and coat both sides, gently pressing the breadcrumbs onto the cutlet so
            they stick. Set the breaded cutlet aside on the reserved plate. Repeat with the remaining cutlets. Set the
            cutlets aside for 10 minutes or so to allow the breading to stick.</p>
        <em>
            <h3>
                <li>Heat the oil</li>
            </h3>
        </em>
        <p>Set a wire rack over a sheet pan next to your stove. In a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, add enough
            oil to cover your skillet (I used 1/4 cup). Heat until itâ€™s shimmering but not smoking. You can test if the
            oil is ready by dropping in a few breadcrumbs. If they start sizzling gently, the oil is ready. If they
            sizzle loudly and brown very quickly, lower the heat slightly. </p>
        <em>
            <h3>
                <li>Pan fry the cutlets</li>
            </h3>
        </em>
        <p>Cooking in batches to avoid crowding the pan, carefully add 1 or 2 cutlets into the pan. To avoid splattering
            the hot oil, use tongs to lay each cutlet down starting with one tip by the edge of the pan nearest you and
            carefully laying it away from you towards the furthest edge of the pan.</p>
        <em>
            <h3>
                <li>Flip</li>
            </h3>
        </em>
        <p>Cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the cutlets to the wire rack to
            drain and repeat with the remaining cutlets, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil as needed between
            batches.</p>

            <h3>
                <li>Serve</li>
            </h3>
        </em>
        <p>Sprinkle on flaky sea salt to finish (if using.) Serve with lemon wedges to squeeze over the cutlets.</p>
    </ol>
